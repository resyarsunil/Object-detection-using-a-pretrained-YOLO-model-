# Object-detection-using-a-pretrained-YOLO-model-

Pretrained YOLOv8 model is used in this project. 

OUTPUT in Object detection on Image:

-  YOLOv8 successfully detects multiple objects in a single forward pass. 

-  From one image, a total of five objects were detected using the YOLOv8 model. 

-  Among these detections, four objects were classified as persons and one object was classified as a vehicle (bus). 

-  The detected persons had confidence scores of 0.93, 0.92, 0.90, and 0.75, indicating high to moderate certainty. 

-  The detected bus achieved a confidence score of 0.96, showing very high detection reliability.


OUTPUT in Object detection on Video:

-  In the object detection performed on the video, the YOLO model successfully identified vehicles moving along the road. 

-  The detected objects included cars, a truck, and a person, demonstrating the model’s ability to recognize multiple object classes simultaneously. 

-  Objects with clear shape, size, and visibility produced higher confidence scores, indicating stronger model certainty. 

-  Vehicles closer to the camera and with minimal occlusion were detected more accurately.
